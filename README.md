## Hometask 1

To complite task one you need to fix DataProcessorTest unit tests. 
All methods in DataProcessor with "7" in a name should be implemented using Java 7, when other should be done with Java 8 streaming api.


## Hometask 2
The AccidentDataProcessor.processFile sequentially reads, enriches and writes accident data to a file. Serial processing takes much time. Use multithreading
to run these tasks in parallel and communicate to each other to reduce time.

**As the data size and processing complexity is low here the performance gain by multithreading might be little. To simulate complex data heavy processing
I have introduced a delay of 1 second in data reader, data enricher and data writer. The usage is via Util.sleep(). You can increase the time here or switch
it off to play around.

Below task is optional if somebody is interested to play with more.
For more complicated scenario change to use PoliceForceExternalDataService.getContactNoWithDelay() from enricher to
simulate the scenario that enrichment from 3rd party service may get stuck. As a solution this can be run in a separate
thread and the result should be returned using Future with a timeout
